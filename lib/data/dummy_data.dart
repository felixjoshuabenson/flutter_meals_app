It may feel dry during the mixing but do not be tempted to add more liquid because the liquid you have in the bowl should be enough. You just need a bit of arm power to mix it. But if you really really can't get it to form a dough, add a tiny quantity of water bit by bit till the dough is formed.",
      "When done, cover the bowl and leave the dough to rest for about 15 minutes.",
      "After 15 minutes, you will notice that the dough is softer. Knead very well.",
      "Roll out small bits of dough and cut with a knife or a pizza cutter as shown in the video below. Do not use flour to dust Nigerian Chin Chin because this causes the oil to foam during frying.
